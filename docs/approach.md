# Django Rest Framework (DRF) to create a central Django REST API that serves data to multiple domains. This approach is commonly known as a headless or decoupled CMS.



## Django REST API for Shared Data:

1. **Create a Django application to serve as the backend for your main domain.**
2. **Implement Django Rest Framework to expose endpoints for shared data, including shared user and business models.**

## Cross-Domain Data Retrieval:

1. **Use AJAX requests or any other HTTP client (like axios in JavaScript) on the frontend of your other domains to fetch data from the main domain's REST API.**
2. **Ensure that CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is configured correctly on the main domain to allow requests from other domains.**

## Shared Profile Model:

1. **Include shared profile data in the Django Rest API, making it accessible to all domains.**

## Shared User and Business Models:

1. **Expose endpoints for user and business data through the API.**
2. **Handle authentication securely to ensure only authorized requests can access sensitive data.**

## Template Retrieval:

1. **Use the same approach to fetch templates from the main domain. You can store HTML templates or use a template engine like Django templating for dynamic content.**

## Custom Models for Each Domain:

1. **If there are domain-specific data or models, you can create additional API endpoints on the main domain to provide this data.**

## Versioning and Documentation:

1. **Implement versioning in your API to manage changes over time.**
2. **Document your API thoroughly to guide developers on how to use it.**

## GitHub for Template Management:

1. **You can use GitHub to version control and manage your templates. Changes made on the main domain can be pushed to the GitHub repository, and other domains can pull these changes when needed.**

## Security Considerations:

1. **Ensure that your API is secure, especially since it will be accessed from different domains. Use HTTPS and implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.**

## Testing and Optimization:

1. **Thoroughly test data retrieval and template rendering across domains.**
2. **Optimize API responses and template loading for performance.**

1. **Install Django Rest Framework:**
   - Install Django Rest Framework.

2. **Create API Endpoints:**
   - Create API endpoints for shared data (user, business models).

3. **Token-Based Authentication:**
   - Implement token-based authentication.

4. **Configure CORS:**
   - Configure CORS to allow requests from authorized domains.

## Shared Models

- **Define and Expose:**
  - Define and expose shared data models through the API.

## Token Authentication

- **Implement Token Authentication:**
  - Implement token authentication for secure access.

## Allowed Domains

- **Configure CORS:**
  - Configure CORS to allow requests only from specific authorized domains.

## Other Domains

### Data Retrieval

- **Use AJAX Requests:**
  - Use AJAX requests or any HTTP client on the frontend to fetch data from the API on HeadDomain.com.

### Authorization

- **Ensure Token Inclusion:**
  - Ensure that each request includes the necessary authentication token for authorization.

## Notes

### Token Authentication

- **Generate and Provide Tokens:**
  - Generate and provide tokens to authorized domains.
  - Include the token in the request headers when making API calls.

### CORS Configuration

- **Use django-cors-headers:**
  - In Django, you can use the `django-cors-headers` package to handle CORS.
  - Configure it to allow requests from specific domains.

### Domain Filtering

- **Optional Filtering:**
  - Optionally, you can modify your API views to filter data based on the requesting domain.
  - This could involve checking the domain in the request headers.
























## MainDomain.com:

- **Global Users and Companies:** Users and companies register and manage their profiles on the main domain.
- **Global Job Listings:** All job listings are created and managed centrally on the main domain.

## Other Domains:

- **Data Retrieval:** Other domains make GET requests to the main domain to fetch data such as company profiles and job listings.
- **Domain-Specific Filtering:** The data retrieved is filtered based on the specific domain or niche.

## Global User Authentication:

- **User Authentication:** Users can register or log in on any connected domain with the same login credentials. This ensures a seamless experience for users across all domains.
